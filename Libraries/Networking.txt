TCP/IP Five Layer Networking Model

Application - HTTP, SMTP - Messages - n/a
Transport - TCP/UDP - Segment - Port #'s => Sorts out client and servers.
Network - IP - Packet / Datagram - IP Address => Network to Network
Data Link - Ethernet, Wi-Fi - Frames - MAC Address => Interpreting Signals
Physical - n/a - Bits - n/a => Networking Cables and Connectors

OSI Model:
https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/standards/osi-model-overview-543
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model

Cables: Copper and Fibre
Copper wires inside Plastic Covers => Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6 => Pulsating Voltage 
Fiber - Pulses of light, tiny glass tube width of hair

Hubs and Switches:

Hubs - Data Collision, Lot of Waiting - Physical Layer Device
Network Switch - Data Link Device => Send data to only one device by parsing Ethernet

Router - Network Layer Device => Parses IP data and maintains IP Table. Determines where to send data based on IP.
    Core ISP Router - BGP - Border Gateway Protocol

Physical Layer:
Transporting bits - 1s and 0s
Modulation: varying voltage (Encoder, Decoder) 10 billion bits/Sec

Twisted Pair Cabling: 
Cat6 => 4 pairs (8 wires) => 2 pairs for sending, 2 pairs for receiving.
Duplex Communication
Unshielded TP, Shielded TP, Foiled TP
RJ45 Plug -> plugged into network port => link and activity LEDs.
Patch Panel -> Container for Network Ports.

Data Link Layer:
-----------------

Ethernet and MAC Addresses:
Ethernet: Protocol to send data
CSMA/CD => Device is free to transmit data. (Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

<!-- read more -->
MAC Address: Media Access Control Address
Global unique identifier attached to an individual network interface
48-bit number => 6 groupings of hexadecimal pairs
First three octets: Organizationally Unique Identifier
Last three octets: On their own

<! -- read more -->
Unicast: One receiving address
LSB in first octet of a destination address is 0, ethernet frame only for one destination address
Multicast: is 1, Multiple receiving address. Criteria other than just mac address. 
Broadcast: Ethernet Broadcast Address. all Fs. Sent to all devices on a LAN 

<!-- read more -->
Ethernet Frame: 
Data Packet at Ethernet Level is Ethernet Frame:
highly structured collection of info presented in a spec order

Preamble - SFD - Dest Address -  Source Address - VLAN Header - EtherType - Payload - FCS
7 bytes -  1  -       6      -         6       -    4        -    2       - 46-1500 -  4

SFD - Start Frame Delimiter
VLAN - virtualLAN  
FCS - Frame Check Sequence - Checksum Value - CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check)
Ethernet - Data Integrity only and not Data Recovery.


Network Layer
--------------

IPv4 => 32 Bits. 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255
dotted decimal notation.

90.0.0.1 => IBM (9 in first octet = IBM's IP)
IP Address belongs to Network that you are connected on.
When you change network, your IP address changes.

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) => Dynamic IP Address
Static IPs => Servers and Network Devices reserved

IP Datagram Header: 2 Parts => Header & Payload
Header is min 20 bytes => 160 bits

(Read More)
Header Content: Version 4 bits (IPv4, IPv6), Header Length (4 bit) => 1 byte total
Service Type 8 bits (QoS Services) => 1 byte
Total Length 16 bits => 2 bytes
Identification Field 16 bits (?) => 2 bytes
Flags & Fragmentation Offset => 16 bits => Taking single IP datagram and splitting. => 2 bytes
Max. size = 65535 bits.
TTL Field => 8 bits => Router Hops allowed (full form?) => 1 byte
Protocol => 8 bit => Transport Layer Protocol (TCP/UDP details) => 1 byte
Header Checksum => 16 bit => 2 byte
Source IP => 32 bit => 4 byte
Destination IP => 32 bit => 4 byte
IP Options, Padding => Total 32 bits, Testing purposes => 4 byte additional

IP Address => Network ID : Subnet ID : Host ID
Network ID + Subnet ID = network portion of IP address
Number of devices on a network = 2 ^ total number of host IDs available.
0 => reserved for network address => address of the entire network => Packets sent here are typically configured to be discarded or ignored.
255 => reserved for broadcast message

Address Class System => Class A (1 Octet NetID), Class B (2 Octet NetID), Class C (3 Octet NetID) => Historic, CIDR is used these days.

IP Address => 32 bits => 4 Octets => 8 bits : 8 bits : 8 bits : 8 bits

A 0xxx 0
B 10xx 128
C 110x 192
D 1110 224 reserved for multicast addresses. Sending data to multiple devices simultaneously.
E 1111 240 unassigned, experimental purposes. Not used for general networking

Address Resolution Protocol:
Discover hardware address of node with certain IP address.
ARP table => Table of IP Address - MAC Address

ARP Broadcast Messages => ARP Response with MAC Address (ARP reply is unicast)
Local ARP Table mdhe stored.
ARP Table expires in short time.

ARP is only needed in a local network.
From router onwards, routing is done based on IP address and not MAC address.
To form an ethernet packet, router puts it's own IP Address as Source MAC address and gateway router's MAC address as destination MAC address.
But the hops are made based on destination IP, rather than these MAC addresses.

Class A = /8, B = /16, C = /24 By Default. 

In the early days, of classful networking,
If a company requires 200 IP address, one block from Class C range would be assigned
for 50,000 IP addresses, block from Class B would be assigned.
for >65000 IP addresses, block from Class A would be assigned. 

for 25,000 IP Addresses, either you waste 40,000 IPs or buy 98 /24 blocks from Class C range.

CIDR was adopted from 1993.

Now, if you need 300 IP address, you receive a /23.
                 1000 IP addresses, you receive a /22
                 25,000 IP addresses, you receive a /17

Now, FLSM and VLSM => Fixed-Length, Varied-Length Subnet Mask
This is how IP address space is assigned within in each organisation, and not by IANA/RIRs.

For eg, if 9.9.9.0/24 is assigned to you from IANA. 

Now, you can apply a subnet mask of your own, /27 to divide your own IP space.
So you end up with, 9.9.9.0 /27
                    9.9.9.32 /27
                    9.9.9.64 /27
and so on.
This was used earlier to save transmitting bits of subnet mask. 

Subnetting: 
//////////// OLD INFO START ///////////////
Taking a large network and splitting into subnets.
9.100.100.100 => 9.O.O.O Gateway Router => Subnet Router
Core Router => Network ID => Gateway Router
SubnetID: Network Portion, (IPv4 & Subnet Mask) => Address of Sub-Network itself.

Subnet Masks => 32 bits.
255.255.255.0 => (256 address) 1-254 hosts.
255.255.255.224 => 5 bits of HOST ID space => 32 hosts
Shorthand way of writing subnet => 9.100.100.100/27 
27 = 27 1s 5 0s => 255.255.255.224

When IP Address is ANDED with subnet mask, we get the IP address of the network.
This IP address is used to identify the subnet network within a large network.
//////////// OLD INFO END ///////////////


CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Rounting
Demarcation Point: One network or system ends and another one begins.
"/" Cider Notation.

a.b.c.d/e in CIDR, represents an IP address, where in e bits are reserved for network portion and remaining are host bits. 

9.100.100.100
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
=> 9.100.100.100.0

Routers: (min 2 network interfaces)
A networking device that forwards traffic.

Home Router: WLAN

Receive Packet => Examine Destination IP => Look through Routing Table => Forward to next hop

Router => Strips away data link layer.
Inspect and find destination IP.
Checks router table
decrements TTL, checksum calculate
Source MAC address = Router self, dest = network it wants to send

Router has a Routing Table, assigns a Metric to each path based on bandwidth, delay, reliability, hop count. Chooses path with lowest metric.
Shares routing updates with neighbouring routers to learn about network topology changes
Has an algorithm for Shortest Path Algorithm like Djikstra's. Bellman Ford.

Routing Table:
Destination Network => Next HOP => Total Hops => Interface
Each network that router knows 

Routing Protocols => special protocols routers used to speak to each other.
IGP and EGP

Interior Gateway Protocols:
Share info in a single autonomous system.
Eg: Company, ISP

Two types of IGP:
    Link State, Distance Vector Protocol

LS => OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
DV => RIP, EIGRP (Routing Information Protocol)

Exterior Gateway Protocol: BGP
IANA => manage things like IP Address Allocation

(?) ASN - Autonomous System Number 
    32 bit numbers 

Request for Comments => Published by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
It is a series of documents that are used to define standards, protocols, procedures, and guidelines for the Internet.
first published in 1969

Non-Routable Address Space: (RFC 1918)

Range of IPs set aside for use by anyone. No core router will not redirect.
10.0.0.0/8
172.16.0.0/12

TCP - Connection Oriented Protocol
Ensures every segment of data sent is acknowledged

UDP - Conectionless Protocol
User Datagram Protocol

A socket is a port that a TCP segment has activated to listen for data requests.
